    Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines
    Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
    All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
    All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
    HTML page lang attribute has been set
    Aria properties have been implemented correctly
    WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed
